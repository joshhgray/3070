Daily Log:

Monday   | set up basic diversity calculation fitness.py w/ unit testing.
Tuesday  | set up config file and loader + integration testing.
         : built template controller.py
Wednesday| worked on controller, added smiles pool and pop generator
Thursday | GA workflow now automated, some kinks to work out and 
         : testing to do.
Friday   | basic front end - attempted w/ flask - I was too unfamiliar -
         : building w/ plotly instead
Saturday | integrated Diversity chart into GA Dashboard. Population ->
         : run GA -> view results pipeline fully automated. Can expand
         : individual components now. Lots of integration testing tmr
Sunday   | Formalizing plan for testing integration.
         : Fixed fitness calculation within GA
         : Worked on drawing new system diagrams and user stories

Reflection:
- Achieved: I have a working MVP
- Challenges: Was facing a lot of issues trying to build front-end with
              flask so I switch to using Dash since I have more exp,
              still took a lot of time.
              
              I think this project is simple enough that big bang
              integration testing should work. I will need to evaluate.
- Next Week: Still need to test everything I've built this week
